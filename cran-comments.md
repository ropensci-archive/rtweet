There might be some errors following links, sometimes Twitter.com or rOpenSci block the CRAN checks of urls.

This submission so close to the previous one is because there is an ERROR in one of the CRAN checks after acceptance.
This is probably caused by a previous version not following CRAN's policy of not writing to user directory.
The example detected a file with the pattern .rtweet_token.*rds in the user directory.
