Use twitter from R. Get started by reading `vignette("rtweet")`.

## Installation

To get the current released version from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("rtweet")
```

<div class="pkgdown-devel">

You can install the development version of rtweet from GitHub with:
`remotes::install_github("rOpenSci/rtweet")`

</div>

## Usage

All users must be authenticated to interact with Twitter’s APIs. The
easiest way to authenticate is to use your personal twitter account -
this will happen automatically (via a browser popup) the first time you
use an rtweet function. See `auth_setup_default()` for details. Using
your personal account is fine for casual use, but if you are trying to
collect a lot of data it’s a good idea to authentication with your own
Twitter “app”. See `vignette("auth", package = "rtweet")` for details.

``` r
library(rtweet)
```

rtweet should be used in strict accordance with Twitter’s [developer
terms](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/more-on-restricted-use-cases).

### Search tweets or users

Search for up to 1000 tweets containing \#rstats, the common hashtag
used to refer to the R language, excluding retweets:

``` r
rt <- search_tweets("#rstats", n = 1000, include_rts = FALSE)
```

Twitter rate limits cap the number of search results returned to 18,000
every 15 minutes. To request more than that, set
`retryonratelimit = TRUE` and rtweet will wait for rate limit resets for
you.

Search for 200 users with the \#rstats in their profile:

``` r
useRs <- search_users("#rstats", n = 200)
```

### Stream tweets

Randomly sample (approximately 1%) from the live stream of all tweets:

``` r
random_stream <- stream_tweets("")
```

Stream all geo-located tweets from London for 60 seconds:

``` r
stream_london <- stream_tweets(location = lookup_coords("london"), timeout = 60)
```

### Get friends and followers

Get all accounts followed by a user:

``` r
## get user IDs of accounts followed by R Foundation
R_Foundation_fds <- get_friends("_R_Foundation")

## lookup data on those accounts
R_Foundation_fds_data <- lookup_users(R_Foundation_fds$to_id)
```

Get all accounts following a user:

``` r
## get user IDs of accounts following R Foundation
R_Foundation_flw <- get_followers("_R_Foundation", n = 100)
R_Foundation_flw_data <- lookup_users(R_Foundation_flw$from_id)
```

If you want *all* followers, you’ll need you’ll need to set `n = Inf`
and `retryonratelimit = TRUE` but be warned that this might take a
*long* time.

### Get timelines

Get the most recent 200 tweets from R Foundation:

``` r
## get user IDs of accounts followed by R Foundation
tmls <- get_timeline("_R_Foundation", n = 100)
```

### Get favorites

Get the 10 most recently favorited statuses by R Foundation:

``` r
favs <- get_favorites("_R_Foundation", n = 10)
```

## Contact

Communicating with Twitter’s APIs relies on an internet connection,
which can sometimes be inconsistent. With that said, if you encounter an
obvious bug for which there is not already an active
[issue](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet/issues), please [create a new
issue](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet/issues/new) with all code used
(preferably a reproducible example) on Github.
