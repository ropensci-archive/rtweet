}
\arguments{
\item{q}{Search query on which to match/filter tweets. See details for
information about available search operators.}

\item{n}{Desired number of results to return. Results are downloaded
in pages when \code{n} is large; the default value will download a single
page. Set \code{n = Inf} to download as many results as possible.

The Twitter API rate limits the number of requests you can perform
in each 15 minute period. The easiest way to download more than that is
to use \code{retryonratelimit = TRUE}.

You are not guaranteed to get exactly \code{n} results back. You will get
fewer results when tweets have been deleted or if you hit a rate limit.
You will get more results if you ask for a number of tweets that's not
a multiple of page size, e.g. if you request \code{n = 150} and the page
size is 200, you'll get 200 results back.}

\item{fromDate}{Oldest date-time (YYYYMMDDHHMM) from which tweets should be
searched for.}

\item{toDate}{Newest date-time (YYYYMMDDHHMM) from which tweets should be
searched for.}

\item{env_name}{Name/label of developer environment to use for the search.}

\item{safedir}{Name of directory to which each response object should be
saved. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created. If NULL (the
default) then a dir will be created in the current working directory. To
override/deactivate safedir set this to FALSE.}

\item{parse}{If \code{TRUE}, the default, returns a tidy data frame. Use \code{FALSE}
to return the "raw" list corresponding to the JSON returned from the
Twitter API.}

\item{token}{Expert use only. Use this to override authentication for
a single API call. In most cases you are better off changing the
default for all calls. See \code{\link[=auth_as]{auth_as()}} for details.}
}
